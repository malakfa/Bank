# Bank
A program that simulates bank clerks updating bank accounts. 
The system includes bank accounts, clerks who update these accounts, a database of transactions to be made and the bank department that initializes the accounts, the clerks, and the repository.
The program delays clerks who are trying to withdraw money that will cause a negative balance, meaning the account will not enter into debt. 
The assigned clerks will wait until enough money is added to the account, whithout busy wait.
